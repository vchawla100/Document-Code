<p style='text-align:justify'>The agreed interest rate for each Facility is based on SME Prime Rate and is subject to change from time to time. </p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>The Default Rate is (i) a rate of 5% per annum above the agreed interest rate for the Relevant Facility (ies) in default, where an interest rate is specified herein, and/or (ii) where no interest rate is specified, the bank may select at its own discretion, a rate of 5% per annum above the agreed interest rate for any other facilities availed by the customer where an interest rate is specified or apply a default rate of 5% per annum above SME Prime Rate. Any overdrawn amounts in your current account(s) or overdraft account(s) would be subject to a default rate of 18% per annum.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>The agreed interest rate for the Facility is based on 3 months EIBOR and is subject to change from time to time.</p>

The first applicable daily 3 months EIBOR rate will be taken two business days prior to the Utilisation of any of the Facilities and will apply for the next 3 months during which any Facilities are provided. Thereafter the EIBOR rates will be reset every subsequent 3 months or as the Bank may deem appropriate. The applicable daily 3 months EIBOR rate will be taken two business days prior to reset date.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>The Late Payment Penalty Rate is (i) a rate of 5% per annum above the agreed interest rate for the relevant facility, where a interest rate is specified herein and (ii) a rate of 5% per annum above 3months EIBOR subject to change from time to time, in respect of Facilities in respect of which no interest rate is specified herein.</p>
